<h1>Hunietro</h1>
A texture pack that changes all base cards as well as 17 jokers, a voucher, the voice lines and dialogue to be Huniepop themed.

The textures cheat a little, often being a higher resolution in 2x than in 1x.
<h2>Installation</h2>
Hunietro is developed for the <a href="https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded" target="_blank">Steamodded</a> launcher. 
However, it is just a texture pack. If you would like, you can alternativly unzip the Balatro.exe file and replace the texture and translation files within without the need for Steammodded.
