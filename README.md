<h1>Hunatro</h1>
A texture pack that changes textures, voice lines and dialogue to be Huniepop themed. Textures modified from textures in Huniecm Studio and Huniepop 2 are used with permission from the developer. All other textures are drawn by me (OneSuchKeeper).

The textures cheat a little, often being a higher resolution in 2x than in 1x.
<h2>Installation</h2>
Hunatro is developed for the <a href="https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded" target="_blank">Steamodded</a> launcher. 
However, it is just a texture pack. If you would like, you can alternativly unzip the Balatro.exe file and replace the texture and translation files within without the need for Steammodded.
<h2>Credits</h2>
All textures are either created by me (<a href="https://github.com/onesuchkeeper" target="_blank">onesuchkeeper</a>), or are modified from textures in <a href="https://huniepop2doubledate.com/" target="_blank">Huniepop 2: Double Date</a> and <a href="https://huniecamstudio.com/" target="_blank">Huniecam Studio</a>.
