    </b>
</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
	Hunatro is developed for the <a href="https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded" target="_blank">Steamodded</a> mod loader. Once Steammodded is installed place the unzipped Hunatro folder in AppData/Roaming/Balatro/Mods. See Steamodded for futher installation guidance.
</p>

<p>
	However, it is just a resource pack. If you would like, you can alternativly unzip the Balatro.exe file and replace the texture and translation files within without the need for Steammodded.
