A resource pack that changes textures, voice lines and dialogue to be Huniepop themed.

<h2>Installation</h2>
Hunatro is developed for the <a href="https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded" target="_blank">Steamodded</a> launcher. Once Steammodded is installed place the unzipped Hunatro folder in AppData/Roaming/Balatro/Mods. See Steamodded for futher installation guidance.<br><br>
However, it is just a resource pack. If you would like, you can alternativly unzip the Balatro.exe file and replace the texture and translation files within without the need for Steammodded.
