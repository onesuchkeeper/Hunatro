A resource pack for Balatro that changes textures, voice lines and dialogue to be Huniepop themed. 

-Installation-

Hunatro is developed for the Steamodded mod loader. Once Steammodded is installed place the unzipped Hunatro folder in AppData/Roaming/Balatro/Mods. See Steamodded for futher installation guidance.

However, it is just a resource pack. If you would like, you can alternativly unzip the Balatro.exe file and replace the texture and translation files within without the need for Steammodded.

-Credits-

Textures modified from textures in Huniepop 2: Double Date and Huniecam Studio are used with permission from the developer. These textures are owned by Huniepot.

Charms for Huniepop 1 and Huniecam Studio characters are by SilverwoodWorks

Development and all other textures are by OneSuchKeeper
